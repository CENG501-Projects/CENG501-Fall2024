# 1. Introduction
An event-based camera is a new sensor modality that operates by detecting changes in pixel intensity rather than capturing entire frames. When a change in intensity occurs at any pixel, the camera reports the pixelâ€™s coordinates, the polarity of the change (indicating whether the intensity increased or decreased), and the precise timestamp of the event. This unique approach enables the camera to achieve high temporal resolution, capturing rapid motion. It also delivers a high dynamic range, allowing it to perform effectively in scenes with extreme lighting contrasts. Furthermore, its design significantly reduces power consumption, making it an energy-efficient alternative to traditional frame-based imaging systems.

The image above depicts a traditional image frame on the left, while the middle panel shows accumulated events over time. In the middle panel, blue represents positive polarity (increased intensity), and red represents negative polarity (decreased intensity). The rightmost panel, on the other hand, illustrates the optical flow.

The motion of each pixel between two successive images is referred to as dense optical flow. This information is crucial for numerous downstream tasks, including Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) and odometry, where understanding motion dynamics is fundamental. While optical flow estimation from conventional image frames has been extensively studied and significantly advanced over the years, estimating optical flow from event-based cameras remains a challenging and less explored area due to the fundamentally different data representation and asynchronous nature of event streams.

A few attempts have been made to estimate optical flow from event streams using conventional neural networks, such as E-RAFT and EV-Flownet. These methods rely on accumulated events to compute the optical flow, effectively adapting traditional image-based approaches to event data. In contrast, Spike-FlowNet employs Integrate-and-Fire (IF) neurons, or spiking neurons, which are more aligned with the asynchronous and sparse nature of event streams.
