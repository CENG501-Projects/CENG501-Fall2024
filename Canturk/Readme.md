# 1. Introduction

Data can come in very different forms such as point clouds or graphs. Numerous applications in cheminformatics or social networks use classification of graphs to get results. Hence, the existence of Neural Networks working on graph-structured data is essential and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) covers this need. However, existing GNN models tries to capture the information of first-order neighboring nodes within a single layer and mostly don't give enough importance to graph substructure and substructure information. In this paper, the proposed method "Substructure Assembling Graph Attention Network" (SA-GAT) not only investigate and extract linear information from higher-order substructures but also focus on their non-linear interaction information via a core module "Substructure Interaction Attention" (SIA).
